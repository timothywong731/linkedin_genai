Often the size, weight, and power consumption of the\\ndigital twin or related controller must be minimized, ideally realized on\\nembedded computing hardware that can operate without a cloud-computing\\nconnection. Here, we show that a nonlinear controller based on next-generation\\nreservoir computing can tackle a difficult control problem: controlling a\\nchaotic system to an arbitrary time-dependent state. The model is accurate,\\nyet it is small enough to be evaluated on a field-programmable gate array\\ntypically found in embedded devices.

The advancement of deep learning in this field has led to deep-\\nlearning knowledge tracing (DLKT) models that prioritize high predictive\\naccuracy. However, many existing DLKT methods overlook the fundamental goal of\\ntracking students\\' dynamical knowledge mastery. These models do not explicitly\\nmodel knowledge mastery tracing processes or yield unreasonable results that\\neducators find difficulty to comprehend and apply in real teaching scenarios.\\nIn response, our research conducts a preliminary analysis of mainstream KT\\napproaches to highlight and explain such unreasonableness. We introduce GRKT,\\na graph-based reasonable knowledge tracing method to address these issues. By\\nleveraging graph neural networks, our approach delves into the mutual\\ninfluences of knowledge concepts, offering a more accurate representation of\\nhow the knowledge mastery evolves throughout the learning process.\\nAdditionally, we propose a fine-grained and psychological three-stage modeling\\nprocess as knowledge retrieval, memory strengthening, and knowledge\\nlearning/forgetting, to conduct a more reasonable knowledge tracing process.\\nComprehensive experiments demonstrate that GRKT outperforms eleven baselines\\nacross three datasets, not only enhancing predictive accuracy but also\\ngenerating more reasonable knowledge tracing results. This makes our model a\\npromising advancement for practical implementation in educational settings.\\nThe source code is available at [this https\\nURL](https://github.com/JJCui96/GRKT).\\n\\n[3] [ arXiv:2406.12897 ](/abs/2406.12897 \"Abstract\") [[pdf](/pdf/2406.12897\\n\"Download PDF\"), [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.12897v1 \"View HTML\"),\\n[other](/format/2406.12897 \"Other formats\")]\\n\\n    \\n\\nTitle: Advancing Histopathology-Based Breast Cancer Diagnosis: Insights into\\nMulti-Modality and Explainability\\n\\n[Faseela\\nAbdullakutty](https://arxiv.org/search/cs?searchtype=author&query=Abdullakutty,+F),\\n[Younes\\nAkbari](https://arxiv.org/search/cs?searchtype=author&query=Akbari,+Y),\\n[Somaya Al-Maadeed](https://arxiv.org/search/cs?searchtype=author&query=Al-\\nMaadeed,+S), [Ahmed\\nBouridane](https://arxiv.org/search/cs?searchtype=author&query=Bouridane,+A),\\n[Rifat\\nHamoudi](https://arxiv.org/search/cs?searchtype=author&query=Hamoudi,+R)\\n\\nComments: 31 pages including references\\n\\nSubjects: Machine Learning (cs.LG); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI); Computer\\nVision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV)\\n\\nIt is imperative that breast cancer is detected precisely and timely to\\nimprove patient outcomes. Diagnostic methodologies have traditionally relied\\non unimodal approaches; however, medical data analytics is integrating diverse\\ndata sources beyond conventional imaging. Using multi-modal techniques,\\nintegrating both image and non-image data, marks a transformative advancement\\nin breast cancer diagnosis. The purpose of this review is to explore the\\nburgeoning field of multimodal techniques, particularly the fusion of\\nhistopathology images with non-image data.

Unfortunately, developers often reuse software libraries in the IoT\\nfirmware, leading to a major security concern. If vulnerabilities or insecure\\nversions of these libraries go unpatched, a massive number of IoT devices can\\nbe impacted. In this paper, we propose the AutoFirm, an automated tool for\\ndetecting reused libraries in IoT firmware at a large scale. Specifically,\\nAutoFirm leverages the syntax information (library name and version) to\\ndetermine whether IoT firmware reuses the libraries. We conduct a large-scale\\nempirical study of reused libraries of IoT firmware, investigating more than\\n6,900+ firmware and 2,700+ distinct vulnerabilities affecting 11,300+\\nvulnerable versions from 349 open-source software libraries. Leveraging this\\ndiverse information set, we conduct a qualitative assessment of vulnerable\\nlibrary versions to understand security gaps and the misplaced trust of\\nlibraries in IoT firmware.

In addition to suitable\\nclassification and regression benchmarks, the Reservoir Computer was applied\\nto Post-Quantum Cryptography, with its suitability for this application\\ninvestigated and assessed. The cryptographic algorithm utilised was the\\nLearning with Errors problem, for both encryption and decryption. To achieve\\nthis, the Chua circuit was characterised, in simulation, and by physical\\ncircuit testing. The Reservoir Computer was designed and implemented using the\\nresults of the characterisation. As part of this development, noise was\\nconsidered and mitigated.  \\nThe benchmarks demonstrate that the Reservoir Computer can achieve current\\nliterature benchmarks with low error. However, the results with Learning with\\nErrors suggest that a Chua-based Reservoir Computer is not sufficiently\\ncomplex to tackle the high non-linearity in Post-Quantum Cryptography. Future\\nwork would involve researching the use of different combinations of multiple\\nChua Reservoir Computers in larger neural network architectures. Such\\narchitectures may produce the required high-dimensional behaviour to achieve\\nthe Learning with Errors problem.  \\nThis project is believed to be only the second instance of a Chua-based\\nReservoir Computer in academia, and it is the first to be applied to\\nchallenging real-world tasks such as Post-Quantum Cryptography. It is also\\noriginal by its investigation of hitherto unexplored parameters, and their\\nimpact on performance.

Neural\\nnetworks are the modern building blocks for artificial intelligence. Modern\\nneural network-based computer vision models are often used for object\\nclassification tasks. Correctly classifying objects with \\\\textit{certainty}\\nhas become of great importance in recent times. However, quantifying the\\ninherent \\\\textit{uncertainty} of the output from neural networks is a\\nchallenging task.

By adding perturbation of different levels, on different parts,\\nranging from the input to the parameters of the network, one introduces\\nentropy to the system. By quantifying and evaluating the perturbed models on\\nthe proposed PI and PSI metrics, we can conclude that our theoretical\\nframework can grant insight into the uncertainty of predictions of computer\\nvision models. We believe that this theoretical framework can be applied to\\ndifferent applications for neural networks.

The advancement of deep learning in this field has led to deep-\\nlearning knowledge tracing (DLKT) models that prioritize high predictive\\naccuracy. However, many existing DLKT methods overlook the fundamental goal of\\ntracking students\\' dynamical knowledge mastery. These models do not explicitly\\nmodel knowledge mastery tracing processes or yield unreasonable results that\\neducators find difficulty to comprehend and apply in real teaching scenarios.\\nIn response, our research conducts a preliminary analysis of mainstream KT\\napproaches to highlight and explain such unreasonableness. We introduce GRKT,\\na graph-based reasonable knowledge tracing method to address these issues. By\\nleveraging graph neural networks, our approach delves into the mutual\\ninfluences of knowledge concepts, offering a more accurate representation of\\nhow the knowledge mastery evolves throughout the learning process.\\nAdditionally, we propose a fine-grained and psychological three-stage modeling\\nprocess as knowledge retrieval, memory strengthening, and knowledge\\nlearning/forgetting, to conduct a more reasonable knowledge tracing process.\\nComprehensive experiments demonstrate that GRKT outperforms eleven baselines\\nacross three datasets, not only enhancing predictive accuracy but also\\ngenerating more reasonable knowledge tracing results.

However, they face challenges in generalizing to Out-of-\\nDistribution (OOD) datasets, that is, data whose distribution differs from\\nthat seen during training. The OOD detection aims to distinguish data that\\ndeviates from the expected distribution, while maintaining optimal performance\\non in-distribution (ID) data. This paper introduces a novel approach based on\\nOOD detection, termed the Generate Rounded OOD Data (GROD) algorithm, which\\nsignificantly bolsters the generalization performance of transformer networks\\nacross various tasks. GROD is motivated by our new OOD detection Probably\\nApproximately Correct (PAC) Theory for transformer. The transformer has\\nlearnability in terms of OOD detection that is, when the data is sufficient\\nthe outlier can be well represented. By penalizing the misclassification of\\nOOD data within the loss function and generating synthetic outliers, GROD\\nguarantees learnability and refines the decision boundaries between inlier and\\noutlier. This strategy demonstrates robust adaptability and general\\napplicability across different data types. Evaluated across diverse OOD\\ndetection tasks in NLP and CV, GROD achieves SOTA regardless of data format.\\nOn average, it reduces the SOTA FPR@95 from 21.97% to 0.12%, and improves\\nAUROC from 93.62% to 99.98% on image classification tasks, and the SOTA FPR@95\\nby 12.89% and AUROC by 2.27% in detecting semantic text outliers.

In addition to suitable\\nclassification and regression benchmarks, the Reservoir Computer was applied\\nto Post-Quantum Cryptography, with its suitability for this application\\ninvestigated and assessed. The cryptographic algorithm utilised was the\\nLearning with Errors problem, for both encryption and decryption. To achieve\\nthis, the Chua circuit was characterised, in simulation, and by physical\\ncircuit testing. The Reservoir Computer was designed and implemented using the\\nresults of the characterisation. As part of this development, noise was\\nconsidered and mitigated.  \\nThe benchmarks demonstrate that the Reservoir Computer can achieve current\\nliterature benchmarks with low error. However, the results with Learning with\\nErrors suggest that a Chua-based Reservoir Computer is not sufficiently\\ncomplex to tackle the high non-linearity in Post-Quantum Cryptography. Future\\nwork would involve researching the use of different combinations of multiple\\nChua Reservoir Computers in larger neural network architectures.

The advancement of deep learning in this field has led to deep-\\nlearning knowledge tracing (DLKT) models that prioritize high predictive\\naccuracy. However, many existing DLKT methods overlook the fundamental goal of\\ntracking students\\' dynamical knowledge mastery. These models do not explicitly\\nmodel knowledge mastery tracing processes or yield unreasonable results that\\neducators find difficulty to comprehend and apply in real teaching scenarios.\\nIn response, our research conducts a preliminary analysis of mainstream KT\\napproaches to highlight and explain such unreasonableness. We introduce GRKT,\\na graph-based reasonable knowledge tracing method to address these issues. By\\nleveraging graph neural networks, our approach delves into the mutual\\ninfluences of knowledge concepts, offering a more accurate representation of\\nhow the knowledge mastery evolves throughout the learning process.\\nAdditionally, we propose a fine-grained and psychological three-stage modeling\\nprocess as knowledge retrieval, memory strengthening, and knowledge\\nlearning/forgetting, to conduct a more reasonable knowledge tracing process.\\nComprehensive experiments demonstrate that GRKT outperforms eleven baselines\\nacross three datasets, not only enhancing predictive accuracy but also\\ngenerating more reasonable knowledge tracing results.

However, after consolidating the latest 24 benchmarks, we\\nnoticed three significant imbalances. First, imbalanced programming language.\\n95.8% of benchmarks involve Python, while only 5 benchmarks involve Java.\\nSecond, imbalanced code granularity. Function-/statement-level benchmarks\\naccount for over 83.3% of benchmarks. Only a mere handful extends to\\nclass-/project-levels, and all are limited to Python. Third, lacking advanced\\nfeatures. Existing benchmarks primarily assess basic coding skills, while\\noverlooking advanced Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) features (i.e.,\\nencapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism).  \\nTo fill these gaps, we propose JavaBench, a project-level Java benchmark that\\nexercises OOP features. It comprises four Java projects with 389 methods in\\n106 Java classes. The test coverage is up to 92%, and JavaBench is attested by\\n282 undergraduate students, reaching a 90.93/100 average score (i.e., pass\\nrate against the test suite), ensuring the quality of documentation, code\\nskeleton, and tests. To better evaluate LLM\\'s capability against JavaBench, we\\nintroduce a systematic evaluation design covering three context settings and\\nfive synthesis strategies at two granularities using three hierarchical\\nmetrics. Our extensive experiment yields several interesting findings. First,\\nwe noticed that regarding project-level Java programming, LLMs are far behind\\nundergraduate students (no project can be correctly completed by any studied\\nLLMs, and at most 41.17% Pass@5 in a more relaxed evaluation). Second, using\\nmethod signature as prompt context may strike an ideal balance for project-\\nlevel code generation.

Specifically, optics problems such as estimating semiconductor device\\nstructures and designing nanophotonic devices provide intriguing research\\ntopics with far-reaching real world impact. Traditional algorithms for such\\ntasks require iteratively refining parameters through simulations, which often\\nyield sub-optimal results due to the high computational cost of both the\\nalgorithms and EM simulations. Machine learning (ML) emerged as a promising\\ncandidate to mitigate these challenges, and optics research community has\\nincreasingly adopted ML algorithms to obtain results surpassing classical\\nmethods across various tasks. To foster a synergistic collaboration between\\nthe optics and ML communities, it is essential to have an EM simulation\\nsoftware that is user-friendly for both research communities. To this end, we\\npresent Meent, an EM simulation software that employs rigorous coupled-wave\\nanalysis (RCWA). Developed in Python and equipped with automatic\\ndifferentiation (AD) capabilities, Meent serves as a versatile platform for\\nintegrating ML into optics research and vice versa. To demonstrate its utility\\nas a research platform, we present three applications of Meent: 1) generating\\na dataset for training neural operator, 2) serving as an environment for the\\nreinforcement learning of nanophotonic device optimization, and 3) providing a\\nsolution for inverse problems with gradient-based optimizers.

In this paper, we focus on multi-modal time-series\\nforecasting, where imprecision due to noisy or incorrect data can lead to\\nerroneous predictions, impacting stakeholders such as analysts, investors, and\\ntraders. Recently, it has been shown that beyond numeric data, graphical\\ntransformations can be used with advanced visual models to achieve better\\nperformance. In this context, we introduce a rating methodology to assess the\\nrobustness of Multi-Modal Time-Series Forecasting Models (MM-TSFM) through\\ncausal analysis, which helps us understand and quantify the isolated impact of\\nvarious attributes on the forecasting accuracy of MM-TSFM.

Based on this benchmark, we\\nconduct extensive experiments with two well-known LLMs (English and Chinese)\\nand four quantization algorithms to investigate this topic in-depth, yielding\\nseveral counter-intuitive and valuable findings, e.g., models quantized using\\na calibration set with the same distribution as the test data are not\\nnecessarily optimal. Besides, to facilitate future research, we also release a\\nmodular-designed toolbox, which decouples the overall pipeline into several\\nseparate components, e.g., base LLM module, dataset module, quantizer module,\\netc. and allows subsequent researchers to easily assemble their methods\\nthrough a simple configuration.

In this work, we explore the\\nrelationship between YouTube VPN ad exposure and users\\' mental models of VPNs,\\nsecurity, and privacy. We use a novel VPN ad detection model to calculate the\\nad exposure of 217 participants via their YouTube watch histories, and we\\ndevelop scales to characterize their mental models in relation to claims\\ncommonly made in VPN ads. Through (pre-registered) regression-based analysis,\\nwe find that exposure to VPN ads is significantly correlated with familiarity\\nwith VPN brands and increased belief in (hyperbolic) threats. While not\\nspecific to VPNs, these threats are often discussed in VPN ads. In contrast,\\nalthough many participants agree with both factual and misleading mental\\nmodels of VPNs that often appear in ads, we find no significant correlation\\nbetween exposure to VPN ads and these mental models. These findings suggest\\nthat, if VPN ads do impact mental models, then it is predominantly emotional\\n(i.e., threat perceptions) rather than technical.\\n\\n[49] [ arXiv:2406.13018 ](/abs/2406.13018 \"Abstract\") [[pdf](/pdf/2406.13018\\n\"Download PDF\"), [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.13018v1 \"View HTML\"),\\n[other](/format/2406.13018 \"Other formats\")]\\n\\n    \\n\\nTitle: Reclaiming Power over AI: Equipping Queer Teens as AI Designers for HIV\\nPrevention\\n\\n[William Liem](https://arxiv.org/search/cs?searchtype=author&query=Liem,+W),\\n[Andrew Berry](https://arxiv.org/search/cs?searchtype=author&query=Berry,+A),\\n[Kathryn\\nMacapagal](https://arxiv.org/search/cs?searchtype=author&query=Macapagal,+K)\\n\\nComments: In CHI 2024: Designing (with) AI for Wellbeing\\n\\nSubjects: Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC)\\n\\nIn this position paper, we explore the potential of generative AI (GenAI)\\ntools in supporting HIV prevention initiatives among LGBTQ+ adolescents.

The advancement of deep learning in this field has led to deep-\\nlearning knowledge tracing (DLKT) models that prioritize high predictive\\naccuracy. However, many existing DLKT methods overlook the fundamental goal of\\ntracking students\\' dynamical knowledge mastery. These models do not explicitly\\nmodel knowledge mastery tracing processes or yield unreasonable results that\\neducators find difficulty to comprehend and apply in real teaching scenarios.\\nIn response, our research conducts a preliminary analysis of mainstream KT\\napproaches to highlight and explain such unreasonableness. We introduce GRKT,\\na graph-based reasonable knowledge tracing method to address these issues. By\\nleveraging graph neural networks, our approach delves into the mutual\\ninfluences of knowledge concepts, offering a more accurate representation of\\nhow the knowledge mastery evolves throughout the learning process.\\nAdditionally, we propose a fine-grained and psychological three-stage modeling\\nprocess as knowledge retrieval, memory strengthening, and knowledge\\nlearning/forgetting, to conduct a more reasonable knowledge tracing process.\\nComprehensive experiments demonstrate that GRKT outperforms eleven baselines\\nacross three datasets, not only enhancing predictive accuracy but also\\ngenerating more reasonable knowledge tracing results.

However, after consolidating the latest 24 benchmarks, we\\nnoticed three significant imbalances. First, imbalanced programming language.\\n95.8% of benchmarks involve Python, while only 5 benchmarks involve Java.\\nSecond, imbalanced code granularity. Function-/statement-level benchmarks\\naccount for over 83.3% of benchmarks. Only a mere handful extends to\\nclass-/project-levels, and all are limited to Python. Third, lacking advanced\\nfeatures. Existing benchmarks primarily assess basic coding skills, while\\noverlooking advanced Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) features (i.e.,\\nencapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism).  \\nTo fill these gaps, we propose JavaBench, a project-level Java benchmark that\\nexercises OOP features. It comprises four Java projects with 389 methods in\\n106 Java classes. The test coverage is up to 92%, and JavaBench is attested by\\n282 undergraduate students, reaching a 90.93/100 average score (i.e., pass\\nrate against the test suite), ensuring the quality of documentation, code\\nskeleton, and tests. To better evaluate LLM\\'s capability against JavaBench, we\\nintroduce a systematic evaluation design covering three context settings and\\nfive synthesis strategies at two granularities using three hierarchical\\nmetrics. Our extensive experiment yields several interesting findings. First,\\nwe noticed that regarding project-level Java programming, LLMs are far behind\\nundergraduate students (no project can be correctly completed by any studied\\nLLMs, and at most 41.17% Pass@5 in a more relaxed evaluation). Second, using\\nmethod signature as prompt context may strike an ideal balance for project-\\nlevel code generation.

Specifically, optics problems such as estimating semiconductor device\\nstructures and designing nanophotonic devices provide intriguing research\\ntopics with far-reaching real world impact. Traditional algorithms for such\\ntasks require iteratively refining parameters through simulations, which often\\nyield sub-optimal results due to the high computational cost of both the\\nalgorithms and EM simulations. Machine learning (ML) emerged as a promising\\ncandidate to mitigate these challenges, and optics research community has\\nincreasingly adopted ML algorithms to obtain results surpassing classical\\nmethods across various tasks. To foster a synergistic collaboration between\\nthe optics and ML communities, it is essential to have an EM simulation\\nsoftware that is user-friendly for both research communities. To this end, we\\npresent Meent, an EM simulation software that employs rigorous coupled-wave\\nanalysis (RCWA). Developed in Python and equipped with automatic\\ndifferentiation (AD) capabilities, Meent serves as a versatile platform for\\nintegrating ML into optics research and vice versa. To demonstrate its utility\\nas a research platform, we present three applications of Meent: 1) generating\\na dataset for training neural operator, 2) serving as an environment for the\\nreinforcement learning of nanophotonic device optimization, and 3) providing a\\nsolution for inverse problems with gradient-based optimizers.

Although chat templates are shown to be effective in\\noptimizing LLM performance, their impact on safety alignment of LLMs has been\\nless understood, which is crucial for deploying LLMs safely at scale.  \\nIn this paper, we investigate how chat templates affect safety alignment of\\nLLMs. We identify a common vulnerability, named ChatBug, that is introduced by\\nchat templates. Our key insight to identify ChatBug is that the chat templates\\nprovide a rigid format that need to be followed by LLMs, but not by users.\\nHence, a malicious user may not necessarily follow the chat template when\\nprompting LLMs. Instead, malicious users could leverage their knowledge of the\\nchat template and accordingly craft their prompts to bypass safety alignments\\nof LLMs. We develop two attacks to exploit the ChatBug vulnerability. We\\ndemonstrate that a malicious user can exploit the ChatBug vulnerability of\\neight state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs and effectively elicit unintended responses\\nfrom these models. Moreover, we show that ChatBug can be exploited by existing\\njailbreak attacks to enhance their attack success rates. We investigate\\npotential countermeasures to ChatBug. Our results show that while adversarial\\ntraining effectively mitigates the ChatBug vulnerability, the victim model\\nincurs significant performance degradation.

The advancement of deep learning in this field has led to deep-\\nlearning knowledge tracing (DLKT) models that prioritize high predictive\\naccuracy. However, many existing DLKT methods overlook the fundamental goal of\\ntracking students\\' dynamical knowledge mastery. These models do not explicitly\\nmodel knowledge mastery tracing processes or yield unreasonable results that\\neducators find difficulty to comprehend and apply in real teaching scenarios.\\nIn response, our research conducts a preliminary analysis of mainstream KT\\napproaches to highlight and explain such unreasonableness. We introduce GRKT,\\na graph-based reasonable knowledge tracing method to address these issues. By\\nleveraging graph neural networks, our approach delves into the mutual\\ninfluences of knowledge concepts, offering a more accurate representation of\\nhow the knowledge mastery evolves throughout the learning process.\\nAdditionally, we propose a fine-grained and psychological three-stage modeling\\nprocess as knowledge retrieval, memory strengthening, and knowledge\\nlearning/forgetting, to conduct a more reasonable knowledge tracing process.\\nComprehensive experiments demonstrate that GRKT outperforms eleven baselines\\nacross three datasets, not only enhancing predictive accuracy but also\\ngenerating more reasonable knowledge tracing results.

However, after consolidating the latest 24 benchmarks, we\\nnoticed three significant imbalances. First, imbalanced programming language.\\n95.8% of benchmarks involve Python, while only 5 benchmarks involve Java.\\nSecond, imbalanced code granularity. Function-/statement-level benchmarks\\naccount for over 83.3% of benchmarks. Only a mere handful extends to\\nclass-/project-levels, and all are limited to Python. Third, lacking advanced\\nfeatures. Existing benchmarks primarily assess basic coding skills, while\\noverlooking advanced Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) features (i.e.,\\nencapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism).  \\nTo fill these gaps, we propose JavaBench, a project-level Java benchmark that\\nexercises OOP features. It comprises four Java projects with 389 methods in\\n106 Java classes. The test coverage is up to 92%, and JavaBench is attested by\\n282 undergraduate students, reaching a 90.93/100 average score (i.e., pass\\nrate against the test suite), ensuring the quality of documentation, code\\nskeleton, and tests. To better evaluate LLM\\'s capability against JavaBench, we\\nintroduce a systematic evaluation design covering three context settings and\\nfive synthesis strategies at two granularities using three hierarchical\\nmetrics. Our extensive experiment yields several interesting findings. First,\\nwe noticed that regarding project-level Java programming, LLMs are far behind\\nundergraduate students (no project can be correctly completed by any studied\\nLLMs, and at most 41.17% Pass@5 in a more relaxed evaluation). Second, using\\nmethod signature as prompt context may strike an ideal balance for project-\\nlevel code generation.

Specifically, optics problems such as estimating semiconductor device\\nstructures and designing nanophotonic devices provide intriguing research\\ntopics with far-reaching real world impact. Traditional algorithms for such\\ntasks require iteratively refining parameters through simulations, which often\\nyield sub-optimal results due to the high computational cost of both the\\nalgorithms and EM simulations. Machine learning (ML) emerged as a promising\\ncandidate to mitigate these challenges, and optics research community has\\nincreasingly adopted ML algorithms to obtain results surpassing classical\\nmethods across various tasks. To foster a synergistic collaboration between\\nthe optics and ML communities, it is essential to have an EM simulation\\nsoftware that is user-friendly for both research communities. To this end, we\\npresent Meent, an EM simulation software that employs rigorous coupled-wave\\nanalysis (RCWA). Developed in Python and equipped with automatic\\ndifferentiation (AD) capabilities, Meent serves as a versatile platform for\\nintegrating ML into optics research and vice versa. To demonstrate its utility\\nas a research platform, we present three applications of Meent: 1) generating\\na dataset for training neural operator, 2) serving as an environment for the\\nreinforcement learning of nanophotonic device optimization, and 3) providing a\\nsolution for inverse problems with gradient-based optimizers.

Recently, it has been shown that beyond numeric data, graphical\\ntransformations can be used with advanced visual models to achieve better\\nperformance. In this context, we introduce a rating methodology to assess the\\nrobustness of Multi-Modal Time-Series Forecasting Models (MM-TSFM) through\\ncausal analysis, which helps us understand and quantify the isolated impact of\\nvarious attributes on the forecasting accuracy of MM-TSFM. We apply our novel\\nrating method on a variety of numeric and multi-modal forecasting models in a\\nlarge experimental setup (six input settings of control and perturbations, ten\\ndata distributions, time series from six leading stocks in three industries\\nover a year of data, and five time-series forecasters) to draw insights on\\nrobust forecasting models and the context of their strengths. Within the scope\\nof our study, our main result is that multi-modal (numeric + visual)\\nforecasting, which was found to be more accurate than numeric forecasting in\\nprevious studies, can also be more robust in diverse settings.

A\\nstable integration of the fast dynamics requires a highly accurate\\napproximation whereas for the simulation of the slow part, a coarser\\napproximation is accurate enough. With regard to the general goals of any\\nnumerical method, high accuracy and low computational costs, a popular\\napproach is to treat the slow and the fast part of a system differently.\\nEmbedding this approach in a variational framework is the keystone of this\\nwork.

These findings suggest\\nthat, if VPN ads do impact mental models, then it is predominantly emotional\\n(i.e., threat perceptions) rather than technical.\\n\\n[49] [ arXiv:2406.13018 ](/abs/2406.13018 \"Abstract\") [[pdf](/pdf/2406.13018\\n\"Download PDF\"), [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.13018v1 \"View HTML\"),\\n[other](/format/2406.13018 \"Other formats\")]\\n\\n    \\n\\nTitle: Reclaiming Power over AI: Equipping Queer Teens as AI Designers for HIV\\nPrevention\\n\\n[William Liem](https://arxiv.org/search/cs?searchtype=author&query=Liem,+W),\\n[Andrew Berry](https://arxiv.org/search/cs?searchtype=author&query=Berry,+A),\\n[Kathryn\\nMacapagal](https://arxiv.org/search/cs?searchtype=author&query=Macapagal,+K)\\n\\nComments: In CHI 2024: Designing (with) AI for Wellbeing\\n\\nSubjects: Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC)\\n\\nIn this position paper, we explore the potential of generative AI (GenAI)\\ntools in supporting HIV prevention initiatives among LGBTQ+ adolescents. GenAI\\noffers opportunities to bridge information gaps and enhance healthcare access,\\nyet it also risks exacerbating existing inequities through biased AI outputs\\nreflecting heteronormative and cisnormative values. We advocate for the\\nimportance of queer adolescent-centered interventions, contend with the\\npromise of GenAI tools while addressing concerns of bias, and position\\nparticipatory frameworks for empowering queer youth in the design and\\ndevelopment of AI tools. Viewing LGBTQ+ adolescents as designers, we propose a\\ncommunity-engaged approach to enable a group of queer teens with sexual health\\neducation expertise to design their own GenAI health tools. Through this\\ncollaborative effort, we put forward participatory ways to develop processes\\nminimizing the potential iatrogenic harms of biased AI models, while\\nharnessing AI benefits for LGBTQ+ teens. In this workshop, we offer\\nspecialized community-engaged knowledge in designing equitable AI tools to\\nimprove LGBTQ+ well-being.\\n\\n[50] [ arXiv:2406.13025 ](/abs/2406.13025 \"Abstract\") [[pdf](/pdf/2406.13025\\n\"Download PDF\"), [html](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.13025v1 \"View HTML\"),\\n[other](/format/2406.13025 \"Other formats\")]\\n\\n    \\n\\nTitle: ABNet: Attention BarrierNet for Safe and Scalable Robot Learning\\n\\n[Wei Xiao](https://arxiv.org/search/cs?searchtype=author&query=Xiao,+W),\\n[Tsun-Hsuan\\nWang](https://arxiv.org/search/cs?searchtype=author&query=Wang,+T), [Daniela\\nRus](https://arxiv.org/search/cs?searchtype=author&query=Rus,+D)\\n\\nComments: 18 pages\\n\\nSubjects: Machine Learning (cs.LG); Robotics (cs.RO); Systems and Control\\n(eess.SY)\\n\\nSafe learning is central to AI-enabled robots where a single failure may lead\\nto catastrophic results.

Barrier-based method is one of the\\n> dominant approaches for safe robot learning.  \\n> However, this method is not scalable, hard to train, and tends to generate\\n> unstable signals under noisy inputs that are challenging to be deployed for\\n> robots. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Attention BarrierNet\\n> (ABNet) that is scalable to build larger foundational safe models in an\\n> incremental manner.  \\n> Each head of BarrierNet in the ABNet could learn safe robot control policies\\n> from different features and focus on specific part of the observation. In\\n> this way, we do not need to one-shotly construct a large model for complex\\n> tasks, which significantly facilitates the training of the model while\\n> ensuring its stable output. Most importantly, we can still formally prove\\n> the safety guarantees of the ABNet. We demonstrate the strength of ABNet in\\n> 2D robot obstacle avoidance, safe robot manipulation, and vision-based end-\\n> to-end autonomous driving, with results showing much better robustness and\\n> guarantees over existing models.\\n\\nComments: | 18 pages  \\n---|---  \\nSubjects: |  Machine Learning (cs.LG); Robotics (cs.RO); Systems and Control (eess.SY)  \\nCite as: | [arXiv:2406.13025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13025) [cs.LG]  \\n  | (or  [arXiv:2406.13025v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13025v1) [cs.LG] for this version)   \\n  \\n## Submission history\\n\\nFrom: Wei Xiao [[view email](/show-email/b9985bef/2406.13025)]  \\n**[v1]** Tue, 18 Jun 2024 19:37:44 UTC (1,240 KB)  \\n\\nFull-text links:\\n\\n## Access Paper:\\n\\nView a PDF of the paper titled ABNet: Attention BarrierNet for Safe and\\nScalable Robot Learning, by Wei Xiao and Tsun-Hsuan Wang and Daniela Rus\\n\\n  * [View PDF](/pdf/2406.13025)\\n  * [HTML (experimental)](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.13025v1)\\n  * [TeX Source](/src/2406.13025)\\n  * [Other Formats](/format/2406.13025)\\n\\n[view license](http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/ \"Rights to\\nthis article\")\\n\\nCurrent browse context:\\n\\ncs.LG\\n\\n[< prev](/prevnext?id=2406.13025&function=prev&context=cs.LG \"previous in cs.LG \\\\(accesskey p\\\\)\")   |   [next >](/prevnext?id=2406.13025&function=next&context=cs.LG \"next in cs.LG \\\\(accesskey n\\\\)\")   \\n\\n[new](/list/cs.LG/new) |  [recent](/list/cs.LG/recent) | [2024-06](/list/cs.LG/2024-06)\\n\\nChange to browse by:\\n\\n[cs](/abs/2406.13025?context=cs)  \\n[cs.RO](/abs/2406.13025?context=cs.RO)  \\n[cs.SY](/abs/2406.13025?context=cs.SY)  \\n[eess](/abs/2406.13025?context=eess)  \\n[eess.SY](/abs/2406.13025?context=eess.SY)  \\n\\n### References & Citations\\n\\n  * [NASA ADS](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/arXiv:2406.13025)\\n  * [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_lookup?arxiv_id=2406.13025)\\n  * [Semantic Scholar](https://api.semanticscholar.org/arXiv:2406.13025)\\n\\n[a](/static/browse/0.3.4/css/cite.css) export BibTeX citation Loading...\\n\\n## BibTeX formatted citation\\n\\n×\\n\\nloading...\\n\\nData provided by:\\n\\n### Bookmark\\n\\n[\\n](http://www.bibsonomy.org/BibtexHandler?requTask=upload&url=https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13025&description=ABNet:\\nAttention BarrierNet for Safe and Scalable Robot Learning \"Bookmark on\\nBibSonomy\") [\\n](https://reddit.com/submit?url=https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13025&title=ABNet:\\nAttention BarrierNet for Safe and Scalable Robot Learning \"Bookmark on\\nReddit\")\\n\\nBibliographic Tools\\n\\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\\n\\nBibliographic Explorer Toggle\\n\\nBibliographic Explorer _([What is the\\nExplorer?](https://info.arxiv.org/labs/showcase.html#arxiv-bibliographic-\\nexplorer))_\\n\\nLitmaps Toggle\\n\\nLitmaps _([What is Litmaps?](https://www.litmaps.co/))_\\n\\nscite.ai Toggle\\n\\nscite Smart Citations _([What are Smart Citations?](https://www.scite.ai/))_\\n\\nCode, Data, Media\\n\\n# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\\n\\nLinks to Code Toggle\\n\\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers _([What is\\nCatalyzeX?](https://www.catalyzex.com))_\\n\\nDagsHub Toggle\\n\\nDagsHub _([What is DagsHub?](https://dagshub.com/))_\\n\\nGotitPub Toggle\\n\\nGotit.pub _([What is GotitPub?](http://gotit.pub/faq))_\\n\\nLinks to Code Toggle\\n\\nPapers with Code _([What is Papers with Code?](https://paperswithcode.com/))_\\n\\nScienceCast Toggle\\n\\nScienceCast _([What is ScienceCast?](https://sciencecast.org/welcome))_\\n\\nDemos\\n\\n# Demos\\n\\nReplicate Toggle\\n\\nReplicate _([What is Replicate?](https://replicate.com/docs/arxiv/about))_\\n\\nSpaces Toggle\\n\\nHugging Face Spaces _([What is\\nSpaces?](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/spaces))_\\n\\nSpaces Toggle\\n\\nTXYZ.AI _([What is TXYZ.AI?](https://txyz.ai))_\\n\\nRelated Papers\\n\\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\\n\\nLink to Influence Flower\\n\\nInfluence Flower _([What are Influence\\nFlowers?](https://influencemap.cmlab.dev/))_\\n\\nConnected Papers Toggle\\n\\nConnected Papers _([What is Connected\\nPapers?](https://www.connectedpapers.com/about))_\\n\\nCore recommender toggle\\n\\nCORE Recommender _([What is CORE?](https://core.ac.uk/services/recommender))_\\n\\nIArxiv recommender toggle\\n\\nIArxiv Recommender _([What is IArxiv?](https://iarxiv.org/about))_\\n\\n  * Author\\n  * Venue\\n  * Institution\\n  * Topic\\n\\nAbout arXivLabs\\n\\n# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\\n\\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new\\narXiv features directly on our website.\\n\\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and\\naccepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy.\\narXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to\\nthem.\\n\\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv\\'s community?

Barrier-based method is one of the\\n> dominant approaches for safe robot learning.  \\n> However, this method is not scalable, hard to train, and tends to generate\\n> unstable signals under noisy inputs that are challenging to be deployed for\\n> robots. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Attention BarrierNet\\n> (ABNet) that is scalable to build larger foundational safe models in an\\n> incremental manner.  \\n> Each head of BarrierNet in the ABNet could learn safe robot control policies\\n> from different features and focus on specific part of the observation. In\\n> this way, we do not need to one-shotly construct a large model for complex\\n> tasks, which significantly facilitates the training of the model while\\n> ensuring its stable output. Most importantly, we can still formally prove\\n> the safety guarantees of the ABNet. We demonstrate the strength of ABNet in\\n> 2D robot obstacle avoidance, safe robot manipulation, and vision-based end-\\n> to-end autonomous driving, with results showing much better robustness and\\n> guarantees over existing models.\\n\\nComments: | 18 pages  \\n---|---  \\nSubjects: |  Machine Learning (cs.LG); Robotics (cs.RO); Systems and Control (eess.SY)  \\nCite as: | [arXiv:2406.13025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13025) [cs.LG]  \\n  | (or  [arXiv:2406.13025v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13025v1) [cs.LG] for this version)   \\n  \\n## Submission history\\n\\nFrom: Wei Xiao [[view email](/show-email/b9985bef/2406.13025)]  \\n**[v1]** Tue, 18 Jun 2024 19:37:44 UTC (1,240 KB)  \\n\\nFull-text links:\\n\\n## Access Paper:\\n\\nView a PDF of the paper titled ABNet: Attention BarrierNet for Safe and\\nScalable Robot Learning, by Wei Xiao and Tsun-Hsuan Wang and Daniela Rus\\n\\n  * [View PDF](/pdf/2406.13025)\\n  * [HTML (experimental)](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.13025v1)\\n  * [TeX Source](/src/2406.13025)\\n  * [Other Formats](/format/2406.13025)\\n\\n[view license](http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/ \"Rights to\\nthis article\")\\n\\nCurrent browse context:\\n\\ncs.LG\\n\\n[< prev](/prevnext?id=2406.13025&function=prev&context=cs.LG \"previous in cs.LG \\\\(accesskey p\\\\)\")   |   [next >](/prevnext?id=2406.13025&function=next&context=cs.LG \"next in cs.LG \\\\(accesskey n\\\\)\")   \\n\\n[new](/list/cs.LG/new) |  [recent](/list/cs.LG/recent) | [2024-06](/list/cs.LG/2024-06)\\n\\nChange to browse by:\\n\\n[cs](/abs/2406.13025?context=cs)  \\n[cs.RO](/abs/2406.13025?context=cs.RO)  \\n[cs.SY](/abs/2406.13025?context=cs.SY)  \\n[eess](/abs/2406.13025?context=eess)  \\n[eess.SY](/abs/2406.13025?context=eess.SY)  \\n\\n### References & Citations\\n\\n  * [NASA ADS](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/arXiv:2406.13025)\\n  * [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_lookup?arxiv_id=2406.13025)\\n  * [Semantic Scholar](https://api.semanticscholar.org/arXiv:2406.13025)\\n\\n[a](/static/browse/0.3.4/css/cite.css) export BibTeX citation Loading...\\n\\n## BibTeX formatted citation\\n\\n×\\n\\nloading...\\n\\nData provided by:\\n\\n### Bookmark\\n\\n[\\n](http://www.bibsonomy.org/BibtexHandler?requTask=upload&url=https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13025&description=ABNet:\\nAttention BarrierNet for Safe and Scalable Robot Learning \"Bookmark on\\nBibSonomy\") [\\n](https://reddit.com/submit?url=https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13025&title=ABNet:\\nAttention BarrierNet for Safe and Scalable Robot Learning \"Bookmark on\\nReddit\")\\n\\nBibliographic Tools\\n\\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\\n\\nBibliographic Explorer Toggle\\n\\nBibliographic Explorer _([What is the\\nExplorer?](https://info.arxiv.org/labs/showcase.html#arxiv-bibliographic-\\nexplorer))_\\n\\nLitmaps Toggle\\n\\nLitmaps _([What is Litmaps?](https://www.litmaps.co/))_\\n\\nscite.ai Toggle\\n\\nscite Smart Citations _([What are Smart Citations?](https://www.scite.ai/))_\\n\\nCode, Data, Media\\n\\n# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\\n\\nLinks to Code Toggle\\n\\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers _([What is\\nCatalyzeX?](https://www.catalyzex.com))_\\n\\nDagsHub Toggle\\n\\nDagsHub _([What is DagsHub?](https://dagshub.com/))_\\n\\nGotitPub Toggle\\n\\nGotit.pub _([What is GotitPub?](http://gotit.pub/faq))_\\n\\nLinks to Code Toggle\\n\\nPapers with Code _([What is Papers with Code?](https://paperswithcode.com/))_\\n\\nScienceCast Toggle\\n\\nScienceCast _([What is ScienceCast?](https://sciencecast.org/welcome))_\\n\\nDemos\\n\\n# Demos\\n\\nReplicate Toggle\\n\\nReplicate _([What is Replicate?](https://replicate.com/docs/arxiv/about))_\\n\\nSpaces Toggle\\n\\nHugging Face Spaces _([What is\\nSpaces?](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/spaces))_\\n\\nSpaces Toggle\\n\\nTXYZ.AI _([What is TXYZ.AI?](https://txyz.ai))_\\n\\nRelated Papers\\n\\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\\n\\nLink to Influence Flower\\n\\nInfluence Flower _([What are Influence\\nFlowers?](https://influencemap.cmlab.dev/))_\\n\\nConnected Papers Toggle\\n\\nConnected Papers _([What is Connected\\nPapers?](https://www.connectedpapers.com/about))_\\n\\nCore recommender toggle\\n\\nCORE Recommender _([What is CORE?](https://core.ac.uk/services/recommender))_\\n\\nIArxiv recommender toggle\\n\\nIArxiv Recommender _([What is IArxiv?](https://iarxiv.org/about))_\\n\\n  * Author\\n  * Venue\\n  * Institution\\n  * Topic\\n\\nAbout arXivLabs\\n\\n# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\\n\\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new\\narXiv features directly on our website.\\n\\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and\\naccepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy.\\narXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to\\nthem.\\n\\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv\\'s community?

The advancement of deep learning in this field has led to deep-\\nlearning knowledge tracing (DLKT) models that prioritize high predictive\\naccuracy.

Unfortunately, developers often reuse software libraries in the IoT\\nfirmware, leading to a major security concern. If vulnerabilities or insecure\\nversions of these libraries go unpatched, a massive number of IoT devices can\\nbe impacted. In this paper, we propose the AutoFirm, an automated tool for\\ndetecting reused libraries in IoT firmware at a large scale. Specifically,\\nAutoFirm leverages the syntax information (library name and version) to\\ndetermine whether IoT firmware reuses the libraries. We conduct a large-scale\\nempirical study of reused libraries of IoT firmware, investigating more than\\n6,900+ firmware and 2,700+ distinct vulnerabilities affecting 11,300+\\nvulnerable versions from 349 open-source software libraries. Leveraging this\\ndiverse information set, we conduct a qualitative assessment of vulnerable\\nlibrary versions to understand security gaps and the misplaced trust of\\nlibraries in IoT firmware.

In addition to suitable\\nclassification and regression benchmarks, the Reservoir Computer was applied\\nto Post-Quantum Cryptography, with its suitability for this application\\ninvestigated and assessed. The cryptographic algorithm utilised was the\\nLearning with Errors problem, for both encryption and decryption. To achieve\\nthis, the Chua circuit was characterised, in simulation, and by physical\\ncircuit testing. The Reservoir Computer was designed and implemented using the\\nresults of the characterisation. As part of this development, noise was\\nconsidered and mitigated.  \\nThe benchmarks demonstrate that the Reservoir Computer can achieve current\\nliterature benchmarks with low error. However, the results with Learning with\\nErrors suggest that a Chua-based Reservoir Computer is not sufficiently\\ncomplex to tackle the high non-linearity in Post-Quantum Cryptography. Future\\nwork would involve researching the use of different combinations of multiple\\nChua Reservoir Computers in larger neural network architectures. Such\\narchitectures may produce the required high-dimensional behaviour to achieve\\nthe Learning with Errors problem.  \\nThis project is believed to be only the second instance of a Chua-based\\nReservoir Computer in academia, and it is the first to be applied to\\nchallenging real-world tasks such as Post-Quantum Cryptography. It is also\\noriginal by its investigation of hitherto unexplored parameters, and their\\nimpact on performance.

The advancement of deep learning in this field has led to deep-\\nlearning knowledge tracing (DLKT) models that prioritize high predictive\\naccuracy. However, many existing DLKT methods overlook the fundamental goal of\\ntracking students\\' dynamical knowledge mastery. These models do not explicitly\\nmodel knowledge mastery tracing processes or yield unreasonable results that\\neducators find difficulty to comprehend and apply in real teaching scenarios.\\nIn response, our research conducts a preliminary analysis of mainstream KT\\napproaches to highlight and explain such unreasonableness. We introduce GRKT,\\na graph-based reasonable knowledge tracing method to address these issues. By\\nleveraging graph neural networks, our approach delves into the mutual\\ninfluences of knowledge concepts, offering a more accurate representation of\\nhow the knowledge mastery evolves throughout the learning process.\\nAdditionally, we propose a fine-grained and psychological three-stage modeling\\nprocess as knowledge retrieval, memory strengthening, and knowledge\\nlearning/forgetting, to conduct a more reasonable knowledge tracing process.\\nComprehensive experiments demonstrate that GRKT outperforms eleven baselines\\nacross three datasets, not only enhancing predictive accuracy but also\\ngenerating more reasonable knowledge tracing results.

However, they face challenges in generalizing to Out-of-\\nDistribution (OOD) datasets, that is, data whose distribution differs from\\nthat seen during training. The OOD detection aims to distinguish data that\\ndeviates from the expected distribution, while maintaining optimal performance\\non in-distribution (ID) data. This paper introduces a novel approach based on\\nOOD detection, termed the Generate Rounded OOD Data (GROD) algorithm, which\\nsignificantly bolsters the generalization performance of transformer networks\\nacross various tasks. GROD is motivated by our new OOD detection Probably\\nApproximately Correct (PAC) Theory for transformer. The transformer has\\nlearnability in terms of OOD detection that is, when the data is sufficient\\nthe outlier can be well represented. By penalizing the misclassification of\\nOOD data within the loss function and generating synthetic outliers, GROD\\nguarantees learnability and refines the decision boundaries between inlier and\\noutlier. This strategy demonstrates robust adaptability and general\\napplicability across different data types. Evaluated across diverse OOD\\ndetection tasks in NLP and CV, GROD achieves SOTA regardless of data format.\\nOn average, it reduces the SOTA FPR@95 from 21.97% to 0.12%, and improves\\nAUROC from 93.62% to 99.98% on image classification tasks, and the SOTA FPR@95\\nby 12.89% and AUROC by 2.27% in detecting semantic text outliers.

In addition to suitable\\nclassification and regression benchmarks, the Reservoir Computer was applied\\nto Post-Quantum Cryptography, with its suitability for this application\\ninvestigated and assessed. The cryptographic algorithm utilised was the\\nLearning with Errors problem, for both encryption and decryption. To achieve\\nthis, the Chua circuit was characterised, in simulation, and by physical\\ncircuit testing. The Reservoir Computer was designed and implemented using the\\nresults of the characterisation. As part of this development, noise was\\nconsidered and mitigated.  \\nThe benchmarks demonstrate that the Reservoir Computer can achieve current\\nliterature benchmarks with low error. However, the results with Learning with\\nErrors suggest that a Chua-based Reservoir Computer is not sufficiently\\ncomplex to tackle the high non-linearity in Post-Quantum Cryptography. Future\\nwork would involve researching the use of different combinations of multiple\\nChua Reservoir Computers in larger neural network architectures.

Barrier-based method is one of the\\n> dominant approaches for safe robot learning.  \\n> However, this method is not scalable, hard to train, and tends to generate\\n> unstable signals under noisy inputs that are challenging to be deployed for\\n> robots. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Attention BarrierNet\\n> (ABNet) that is scalable to build larger foundational safe models in an\\n> incremental manner.  \\n> Each head of BarrierNet in the ABNet could learn safe robot control policies\\n> from different features and focus on specific part of the observation. In\\n> this way, we do not need to one-shotly construct a large model for complex\\n> tasks, which significantly facilitates the training of the model while\\n> ensuring its stable output. Most importantly, we can still formally prove\\n> the safety guarantees of the ABNet. We demonstrate the strength of ABNet in\\n> 2D robot obstacle avoidance, safe robot manipulation, and vision-based end-\\n> to-end autonomous driving, with results showing much better robustness and\\n> guarantees over existing models.\\n\\nComments: | 18 pages  \\n---|---  \\nSubjects: |  Machine Learning (cs.LG); Robotics (cs.RO); Systems and Control (eess.SY)  \\nCite as: | [arXiv:2406.13025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13025) [cs.LG]  \\n  | (or  [arXiv:2406.13025v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13025v1) [cs.LG] for this version)   \\n  \\n## Submission history\\n\\nFrom: Wei Xiao [[view email](/show-email/b9985bef/2406.13025)]  \\n**[v1]** Tue, 18 Jun 2024 19:37:44 UTC (1,240 KB)  \\n\\nFull-text links:\\n\\n## Access Paper:\\n\\nView a PDF of the paper titled ABNet: Attention BarrierNet for Safe and\\nScalable Robot Learning, by Wei Xiao and Tsun-Hsuan Wang and Daniela Rus\\n\\n  * [View PDF](/pdf/2406.13025)\\n  * [HTML (experimental)](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.13025v1)\\n  * [TeX Source](/src/2406.13025)\\n  * [Other Formats](/format/2406.13025)\\n\\n[view license](http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/ \"Rights to\\nthis article\")\\n\\nCurrent browse context:\\n\\ncs.LG\\n\\n[< prev](/prevnext?id=2406.13025&function=prev&context=cs.LG \"previous in cs.LG \\\\(accesskey p\\\\)\")   |   [next >](/prevnext?id=2406.13025&function=next&context=cs.LG \"next in cs.LG \\\\(accesskey n\\\\)\")   \\n\\n[new](/list/cs.LG/new) |  [recent](/list/cs.LG/recent) | [2024-06](/list/cs.LG/2024-06)\\n\\nChange to browse by:\\n\\n[cs](/abs/2406.13025?context=cs)  \\n[cs.RO](/abs/2406.13025?context=cs.RO)  \\n[cs.SY](/abs/2406.13025?context=cs.SY)  \\n[eess](/abs/2406.13025?context=eess)  \\n[eess.SY](/abs/2406.13025?context=eess.SY)  \\n\\n### References & Citations\\n\\n  * [NASA ADS](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/arXiv:2406.13025)\\n  * [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_lookup?arxiv_id=2406.13025)\\n  * [Semantic Scholar](https://api.semanticscholar.org/arXiv:2406.13025)\\n\\n[a](/static/browse/0.3.4/css/cite.css) export BibTeX citation Loading...\\n\\n## BibTeX formatted citation\\n\\n×\\n\\nloading...\\n\\nData provided by:\\n\\n### Bookmark\\n\\n[\\n](http://www.bibsonomy.org/BibtexHandler?requTask=upload&url=https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13025&description=ABNet:\\nAttention BarrierNet for Safe and Scalable Robot Learning \"Bookmark on\\nBibSonomy\") [\\n](https://reddit.com/submit?url=https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13025&title=ABNet:\\nAttention BarrierNet for Safe and Scalable Robot Learning \"Bookmark on\\nReddit\")\\n\\nBibliographic Tools\\n\\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\\n\\nBibliographic Explorer Toggle\\n\\nBibliographic Explorer _([What is the\\nExplorer?](https://info.arxiv.org/labs/showcase.html#arxiv-bibliographic-\\nexplorer))_\\n\\nLitmaps Toggle\\n\\nLitmaps _([What is Litmaps?](https://www.litmaps.co/))_\\n\\nscite.ai Toggle\\n\\nscite Smart Citations _([What are Smart Citations?](https://www.scite.ai/))_\\n\\nCode, Data, Media\\n\\n# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\\n\\nLinks to Code Toggle\\n\\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers _([What is\\nCatalyzeX?](https://www.catalyzex.com))_\\n\\nDagsHub Toggle\\n\\nDagsHub _([What is DagsHub?](https://dagshub.com/))_\\n\\nGotitPub Toggle\\n\\nGotit.pub _([What is GotitPub?](http://gotit.pub/faq))_\\n\\nLinks to Code Toggle\\n\\nPapers with Code _([What is Papers with Code?](https://paperswithcode.com/))_\\n\\nScienceCast Toggle\\n\\nScienceCast _([What is ScienceCast?](https://sciencecast.org/welcome))_\\n\\nDemos\\n\\n# Demos\\n\\nReplicate Toggle\\n\\nReplicate _([What is Replicate?](https://replicate.com/docs/arxiv/about))_\\n\\nSpaces Toggle\\n\\nHugging Face Spaces _([What is\\nSpaces?](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/spaces))_\\n\\nSpaces Toggle\\n\\nTXYZ.AI _([What is TXYZ.AI?](https://txyz.ai))_\\n\\nRelated Papers\\n\\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\\n\\nLink to Influence Flower\\n\\nInfluence Flower _([What are Influence\\nFlowers?](https://influencemap.cmlab.dev/))_\\n\\nConnected Papers Toggle\\n\\nConnected Papers _([What is Connected\\nPapers?](https://www.connectedpapers.com/about))_\\n\\nCore recommender toggle\\n\\nCORE Recommender _([What is CORE?](https://core.ac.uk/services/recommender))_\\n\\nIArxiv recommender toggle\\n\\nIArxiv Recommender _([What is IArxiv?](https://iarxiv.org/about))_\\n\\n  * Author\\n  * Venue\\n  * Institution\\n  * Topic\\n\\nAbout arXivLabs\\n\\n# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\\n\\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new\\narXiv features directly on our website.\\n\\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and\\naccepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy.\\narXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to\\nthem.\\n\\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv\\'s community?

Barrier-based method is one of the\\n> dominant approaches for safe robot learning.  \\n> However, this method is not scalable, hard to train, and tends to generate\\n> unstable signals under noisy inputs that are challenging to be deployed for\\n> robots. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Attention BarrierNet\\n> (ABNet) that is scalable to build larger foundational safe models in an\\n> incremental manner.  \\n> Each head of BarrierNet in the ABNet could learn safe robot control policies\\n> from different features and focus on specific part of the observation. In\\n> this way, we do not need to one-shotly construct a large model for complex\\n> tasks, which significantly facilitates the training of the model while\\n> ensuring its stable output. Most importantly, we can still formally prove\\n> the safety guarantees of the ABNet. We demonstrate the strength of ABNet in\\n> 2D robot obstacle avoidance, safe robot manipulation, and vision-based end-\\n> to-end autonomous driving, with results showing much better robustness and\\n> guarantees over existing models.\\n\\nComments: | 18 pages  \\n---|---  \\nSubjects: |  Machine Learning (cs.LG); Robotics (cs.RO); Systems and Control (eess.SY)  \\nCite as: | [arXiv:2406.13025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13025) [cs.LG]  \\n  | (or  [arXiv:2406.13025v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13025v1) [cs.LG] for this version)   \\n  \\n## Submission history\\n\\nFrom: Wei Xiao [[view email](/show-email/b9985bef/2406.13025)]  \\n**[v1]** Tue, 18 Jun 2024 19:37:44 UTC (1,240 KB)  \\n\\nFull-text links:\\n\\n## Access Paper:\\n\\nView a PDF of the paper titled ABNet: Attention BarrierNet for Safe and\\nScalable Robot Learning, by Wei Xiao and Tsun-Hsuan Wang and Daniela Rus\\n\\n  * [View PDF](/pdf/2406.13025)\\n  * [HTML (experimental)](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.13025v1)\\n  * [TeX Source](/src/2406.13025)\\n  * [Other Formats](/format/2406.13025)\\n\\n[view license](http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/ \"Rights to\\nthis article\")\\n\\nCurrent browse context:\\n\\ncs.LG\\n\\n[< prev](/prevnext?id=2406.13025&function=prev&context=cs.LG \"previous in cs.LG \\\\(accesskey p\\\\)\")   |   [next >](/prevnext?id=2406.13025&function=next&context=cs.LG \"next in cs.LG \\\\(accesskey n\\\\)\")   \\n\\n[new](/list/cs.LG/new) |  [recent](/list/cs.LG/recent) | [2024-06](/list/cs.LG/2024-06)\\n\\nChange to browse by:\\n\\n[cs](/abs/2406.13025?context=cs)  \\n[cs.RO](/abs/2406.13025?context=cs.RO)  \\n[cs.SY](/abs/2406.13025?context=cs.SY)  \\n[eess](/abs/2406.13025?context=eess)  \\n[eess.SY](/abs/2406.13025?context=eess.SY)  \\n\\n### References & Citations\\n\\n  * [NASA ADS](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/arXiv:2406.13025)\\n  * [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_lookup?arxiv_id=2406.13025)\\n  * [Semantic Scholar](https://api.semanticscholar.org/arXiv:2406.13025)\\n\\n[a](/static/browse/0.3.4/css/cite.css) export BibTeX citation Loading...\\n\\n## BibTeX formatted citation\\n\\n×\\n\\nloading...\\n\\nData provided by:\\n\\n### Bookmark\\n\\n[\\n](http://www.bibsonomy.org/BibtexHandler?requTask=upload&url=https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13025&description=ABNet:\\nAttention BarrierNet for Safe and Scalable Robot Learning \"Bookmark on\\nBibSonomy\") [\\n](https://reddit.com/submit?url=https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13025&title=ABNet:\\nAttention BarrierNet for Safe and Scalable Robot Learning \"Bookmark on\\nReddit\")\\n\\nBibliographic Tools\\n\\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\\n\\nBibliographic Explorer Toggle\\n\\nBibliographic Explorer _([What is the\\nExplorer?](https://info.arxiv.org/labs/showcase.html#arxiv-bibliographic-\\nexplorer))_\\n\\nLitmaps Toggle\\n\\nLitmaps _([What is Litmaps?](https://www.litmaps.co/))_\\n\\nscite.ai Toggle\\n\\nscite Smart Citations _([What are Smart Citations?](https://www.scite.ai/))_\\n\\nCode, Data, Media\\n\\n# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\\n\\nLinks to Code Toggle\\n\\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers _([What is\\nCatalyzeX?](https://www.catalyzex.com))_\\n\\nDagsHub Toggle\\n\\nDagsHub _([What is DagsHub?](https://dagshub.com/))_\\n\\nGotitPub Toggle\\n\\nGotit.pub _([What is GotitPub?](http://gotit.pub/faq))_\\n\\nLinks to Code Toggle\\n\\nPapers with Code _([What is Papers with Code?](https://paperswithcode.com/))_\\n\\nScienceCast Toggle\\n\\nScienceCast _([What is ScienceCast?](https://sciencecast.org/welcome))_\\n\\nDemos\\n\\n# Demos\\n\\nReplicate Toggle\\n\\nReplicate _([What is Replicate?](https://replicate.com/docs/arxiv/about))_\\n\\nSpaces Toggle\\n\\nHugging Face Spaces _([What is\\nSpaces?](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/spaces))_\\n\\nSpaces Toggle\\n\\nTXYZ.AI _([What is TXYZ.AI?](https://txyz.ai))_\\n\\nRelated Papers\\n\\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\\n\\nLink to Influence Flower\\n\\nInfluence Flower _([What are Influence\\nFlowers?](https://influencemap.cmlab.dev/))_\\n\\nConnected Papers Toggle\\n\\nConnected Papers _([What is Connected\\nPapers?](https://www.connectedpapers.com/about))_\\n\\nCore recommender toggle\\n\\nCORE Recommender _([What is CORE?](https://core.ac.uk/services/recommender))_\\n\\nIArxiv recommender toggle\\n\\nIArxiv Recommender _([What is IArxiv?](https://iarxiv.org/about))_\\n\\n  * Author\\n  * Venue\\n  * Institution\\n  * Topic\\n\\nAbout arXivLabs\\n\\n# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\\n\\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new\\narXiv features directly on our website.\\n\\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and\\naccepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy.\\narXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to\\nthem.\\n\\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv\\'s community?
